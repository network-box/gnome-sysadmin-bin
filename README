GNOME sysadmin utility scripts
------------------------------

These scripts all live in /home/admin/bin.

 * create-auth
     Sets up the keys based upon groups passed in

 * gen-token
     generates a unique token that can be sent to authenticate an SSH
     key change request

Please remember to add a brief ChangeLog entry and commit any changes, so we
get auto-notification and an audit history of the change sent to the sysadmin
list.
