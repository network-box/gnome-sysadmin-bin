This directory contains scripts that run on git.gnome.org. It is
automatically checked out into /home/admin/gitadmin-bin on every
push to ssh://git.gnome.org/git/gitadmin-bin.

It is only writable by the gitadmin group. (Once the git migration
is finished the gitadmin group will be removed and the permissions
switched to the standard sysadmin group.)
