## Network Box git hooks

This is based on the [GNOME Git hooks](http://git.gnome.org/browse/sysadmin-bin).
Specifically, we only keep the `git/` folder out of their tree.

License of each individual script is the same as the upstream one, we have no
reason to change it.

Feel free to adapt and reuse them for your own purpose.
